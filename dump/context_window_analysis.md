# Context Window Analysis

## Document Stats
- Size: 222,844 characters (~55,477 tokens)
- Lines: 4,537
- GPT-4o context window: 128,000 tokens (can easily fit)

## Why Not Use Full Document in Context?

### 1. **Cost Analysis**
| Approach | Tokens/Request | Cost/Request | 10 Questions | 1000 Questions |
|----------|---------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| V2 Agentic (chunks) | ~5k | $0.013 | $0.13 | $13 |
| V3 Full Context | ~55k | $0.138 | $1.38 | $138 |

**10x more expensive** to use full context every time

### 2. **Performance Issues**
- Larger context = slower processing
- V3 timed out even on first question (>5 min)
- Token generation slows with larger contexts
- Network transfer of 55k tokens adds latency

### 3. **Accuracy Not Guaranteed Better**
- More context can sometimes confuse models
- Relevant info might get lost in noise
- Models perform better with focused context

## Better Alternatives

### Option 1: Hybrid Approach
- Use chunked search first (V2)
- Fall back to full context only if needed
- Best of both worlds

### Option 2: Better Chunking
- Semantic chunking by financial sections
- Create specialized indexes for different data types
- Use metadata filtering

### Option 3: Fine-tuning
- Fine-tune smaller model on Costco data
- Much cheaper inference
- Can encode domain knowledge

## Recommendation
Stick with V2 agentic approach but improve:
1. Better document chunking strategy
2. Add caching for common queries
3. Use full context only as fallback for complex queries
4. Consider adding structured data extraction for tables

## Why Zero Entropy Won't Help
- It's for creative text generation
- Financial data needs accuracy, not creativity
- The problem is retrieval, not generation quality
