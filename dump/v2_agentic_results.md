## Pattern Analysis

### Strong Areas (100% success)
- Explicit calculations with provided numbers
- Common financial metrics (revenue, margins)

### Weak Areas (0% success)
- Specific balance sheet items
- Operational metrics (warehouse count)
- Complex derived metrics (CAPM)

### Tool Usage
- Router correctly identifies calculation vs document search
- Python calculator: 100% accurate when triggered
- Document search: ~40% successful retrieval
- General QA fallback: Used when no specific tool matches

## Actual Accuracy
- Reported: 40% (4/10)
- Corrected: 50% (5/10) after fixing Q2 false negative
