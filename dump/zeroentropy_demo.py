    YOUR CURRENT CHALLENGE:
    -----------------------
    â€¢ Processing large Costco 10-K documents (~220k characters)
    â€¢ Sending entire document to LLM for each query
    â€¢ High token costs (~50k tokens per query)
    â€¢ Slower response times
    â€¢ Potential accuracy issues with large context
    """)
    
    print("""
    ZEROENTROPY SOLUTION:
    --------------------
    ZeroEntropy provides intelligent document reranking that helps you:
    
    1. **SMART CHUNKING & RETRIEVAL**
       - Break documents into manageable chunks
       - Use semantic search to find relevant sections
       - Rerank chunks based on query relevance
       - Send only the most relevant 5-10 chunks to LLM
    
    2. **INTEGRATION WORKFLOW**
       
       Step 1: Document Preparation
       ```python
       # Split Costco 10-K into intelligent chunks
       chunks = create_smart_chunks(costco_10k_text)
       ```
       
       Step 2: Query Processing with ZeroEntropy
       ```python
       # When user asks: "What was Costco's revenue in 2024?"
       
       # Use ZeroEntropy to find and rerank relevant chunks
       relevant_chunks = zeroentropy.rerank(
           query="Costco revenue 2024",
           documents=chunks,
           top_k=5
       )
       ```
       
       Step 3: Focused LLM Processing
       ```python
       # Send only relevant chunks to GPT-4
       context = combine_chunks(relevant_chunks)
       answer = gpt4.complete(prompt=context + query)
       ```
    
    3. **REAL-WORLD EXAMPLE**
       
       Query: "What was Costco's total revenue in fiscal 2024?"
       
       Without ZeroEntropy:
       - Sends entire 220k character document
       - ~55,000 tokens to process
       - Cost: ~$0.55 per query (GPT-4)
       - Response time: 10-15 seconds
       
       With ZeroEntropy:
       - Sends only 5 relevant chunks (~8k characters)
       - ~2,000 tokens to process
       - Cost: ~$0.02 per query (96% reduction!)
       - Response time: 2-3 seconds
       - BONUS: More accurate answers due to focused context
    
    4. **SPECIFIC BENEFITS FOR COSTCO DATA**
       
       âœ… Financial Tables: ZeroEntropy identifies and prioritizes 
          sections with revenue, income statements, balance sheets
       
       âœ… Multi-Query Support: Cache chunks and rerank for different
          questions without reprocessing entire document
       
       âœ… Historical Comparison: Easily compare multiple years by
          retrieving relevant sections from multiple 10-Ks
       
       âœ… Risk Factor Analysis: Quickly find specific risk discussions
          without scanning entire document

    2. Install/Update ZeroEntropy SDK:
       ```bash
       pip install --upgrade zeroentropy
       ```
    
    3. Implement smart chunking strategy:
       - Chunk by sections (Revenue, Expenses, etc.)
       - Maintain section headers for context
       - Use overlapping chunks for continuity
    
    4. Set up reranking pipeline:
       - Pre-filter chunks with basic keyword search
       - Use ZeroEntropy for semantic reranking
       - Cache results for repeated queries
    
    5. Optimize for Costco-specific queries:
       - Create custom prompts for financial metrics
       - Build a knowledge base of common calculations
       - Add validation for financial accuracy
    
    6. Monitor and iterate:
       - Track accuracy improvements
       - Measure cost savings
       - Adjust chunk sizes and top_k parameters
