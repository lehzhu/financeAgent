## The Philosophy

We believe in:
- **Simplicity over complexity** - Three tools beat one mega-tool
- **Domain understanding** - Know your problem space deeply
- **Clear documentation** - If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it
- **Measurable results** - 90% accuracy speaks for itself
